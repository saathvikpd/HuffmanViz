# Huffman Encoding Visualization 🌐

Welcome to the Huffman Encoding Visualization project! This interactive web experience is designed to teach and demonstrate the fascinating process of Huffman encoding, an efficient method of compressing data. Perfect for students, educators, and anyone curious about data compression techniques.

UPDATE: BOOTSTRAP CSS NOT WORKING ON BUILD, ONLY IN DEV. WILL BE FIXING SOON TO IMPROVE USER INTERFACE


## About 📖

Huffman encoding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. This project visualizes each step of the Huffman encoding process, from analyzing character frequency in your input text to building the Huffman tree and generating the encoded output.

Dive into the visualization by entering your text, and watch as the algorithm dynamically creates a visual representation of the Huffman encoding process. The length and complexity of the visualization adapt in real time to your input, making each experience unique!

### Features 🌟

- **Interactive Text Input**: Enter any text to see how it's compressed using Huffman encoding.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Watch as the characters are counted, sorted, and then organized into a Huffman tree right before your eyes.
- **Educational Journey**: Learn about Huffman encoding through a step-by-step visual guide.
- **Responsive and Beautiful Design**: Enjoy the experience on any device, desktop or mobile.
